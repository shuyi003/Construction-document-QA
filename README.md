This repository provides a set of representative workflow codes (Google Colab-compatible) for developing four types of construction-specialized language models (LMs) across varying model scales. These workflows demonstrate the application of domain adaptation strategies tailored to the construction domain.

To facilitate performance evaluation, we also include a curated testing dataset comprising both extractive and open-ended question answering (QA) pairs.

The extractive QA dataset adheres strictly to the SQuAD format, in which each provision is followed by two to three corresponding questions. The labeling codes for the original extractive QA pairs is also included in the repository. The open-ended QA dataset is derived from publicly available sources and follows a one-to-one format, with each question paired with a corresponding free-form answer.

These resources are intended to support reproducibility and future extensions for domain-specific LM development and evaluation in construction document understanding tasks.
