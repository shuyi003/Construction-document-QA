This respository provides codes to develop four types of construction-specialized language models (LMs) at varying scales. 

To evaluate performances of domain-adapted LMs, we provide testing dataset comprising both extractive QA and open-ended QA pairs. 

Specifically, extractive QA pairs strictly follow SQUAD format, with one provision coming two to three following questions. The code to generate original extractive QA pairs is also provided. 
Open-ended QA pairs are derived from public dataset and they follow one question comes with one answer format.
